which ratelimiting algorithm is best and optimized ?

🚀 Popular Rate Limiting Algorithms (With Pros & Cons)

    Algorithm	Description	Pros	Cons	Ideal Use Case
    Token Bucket	Requests use "tokens." Tokens refill at a fixed rate.	Allows bursts, smooths traffic	Slightly complex	APIs that need to handle bursts
    Leaky Bucket	Requests are queued and processed at a fixed rate	Smooth request rate	Not great at burst traffic	Traffic shaping, fixed-rate output
    Fixed Window Counter	Count requests in fixed intervals (e.g., per minute)	Simple, fast	Bursty at window edges	Basic API limits
    Sliding Window Counter	Like fixed window, but "slides" over time	More accurate, smooth	Slightly more complex	Fairer request distribution
    Sliding Log	Tracks each request timestamp	Very accurate	Memory-heavy at scale	Low-traffic APIs or precision-critical systems
    🧠 Recommended: Token Bucket (💡 Best Overall)

Why Token Bucket is often the best:

    Balances burst allowance and sustained throughput

    Works well with Redis via RedisRateLimiter (in Spring Cloud Gateway)

    Default algorithm for Resilience4j + RequestRateLimiter

    🔧 How it works:
    A bucket refills at replenishRate per second.
    
    Can handle burstCapacity sudden requests.
    
    If bucket is empty, request is rejected.

✅ Ideal for:
    Most APIs and microservices
    
    Spring Cloud Gateway with Redis
    
    Protecting backend services from overload
    
    Handling normal + burst traffic gracefully

✨ In Short: What Should You Use?
    ✅ Best for Spring Boot + Redis + Resilience4j / Gateway:

🏆 Token Bucket

  If you're using Spring Cloud Gateway with Redis, it already uses Token Bucket via RedisRateLimiter under the hood. It's fast, scalable, and production-proven.
